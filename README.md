# Tob Fean the Discord Bot
A personal Discord bot that I coded using the Discord Python API called ['Discord.py'](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#). The bot is called 'Tob Fean' which is just 'Naef Bot' but backwards. The functions of the bot range from fun little commands to image manipulation commands. The bot is hosted on the online IDE site, ['replit.com'](https://replit.com/~).

## Commands
- help
  - A custom help command made to make each command easier to understand.

- hello
  - A simple greeting command that sends an embedded message greeting the author with a GIF.

- hbd
  - A command to send an embedded birthday message that wishes the mentioned user a happy birthday. The bot reacts to itself with a cake emoji so that other users can also wish the user a happy birthday.

- element
  - A quick quiz where the bot assigns the author with one of the four elements - Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Based off my favorite cartoon as a child growing up, Avatar: The Last Airbender.

- pogchamp
  - A random command added that has a 1/1000 chance of giving the author the role 'POGCHAMP'.
  
- sad
  - A command added simply as an inside joke between my friends and I. The bot sends an image of Mario and reminds us all that Mario loves us very much.
  
- putin, bflook, drake
  - Some fun image manipulation commands that adds the users' faces over some famous internet memes.
  
- valorant
  - A command added to make it easier for my friends and I to make a lobby on the FPS game Valorant. Valorant is a 5v5 online shooter game and this command allows members of the server to ask if anyone wants to join their lobby as well as shows how many spots are left in the lobby.
